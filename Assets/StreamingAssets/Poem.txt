with strong concentration
I focused on the mighty tower
which was resting
on a grain of sand
the invocation was tumultuous
generated by
swarms of incoherent(?) dancers
I observed characters
of an unknown language
which possibly expressed
her refusal
she was carrying
a young invalid on her back
I recognized him as the Oracle
and waited patiently
for his pronouncement
unfortunately it never came
maybe it was encoded
in the dancers' moves
I waited at the edge
for a long time
while the archers
observed carefully
behind the battlements
and the beat of the drums
filled the valley
meanwhile
I questioned my motives
in the greatest possible
detail
